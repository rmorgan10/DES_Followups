# Steps to implementing KNC

1. check whether all needed sims exist

If yes, move on, if no, trigger needed simulations in parallel

2. check whether pythonized versions of all sims exist

If yes, move on, if no, trigger needed processing in parallel

3. Place cuts on Pythonized light curves in parallel

4. Extract features from all sims and data in parallel

5. Output features to csv

6. Train RFC and classify data

7. Validate current performance

8. Calibrate probabilities to FPR

9. Output sorted classification report


Needed codes
------------
run_knc.py

	Outer shell in DES_Followups/code directory to change to KNC directory and run KNC

knc.py

	Shell to check for existing files and trigger other scripts

generate_all_sims.py
monitor_all_sims.py

process_all_lc.py

	Triggers parse_fits.py on all sims that need it

cut_all_lc.py

	Triggers place_cuts.py on all sims that need it

extract_features.py

	Determine optimal features based on light curve
	Extract features from sims and data
	Make training, validation, and data csv files

classify.py

	Train RFC on training set
	Classify validation set
	Output diagnostics
