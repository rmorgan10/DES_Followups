# Default pipeline logic that includes image-subtraction 
# and detection using software (Human scanning and 
# spectro follow-up are NOT included here).
# First number after "SURVEY:" is the number of epochs 
# required; second argument is the logic for a single-epoch
# detection. 'gr' => g.and.r are required.  A plus-sign '+' 
# => logical-OR. The SDSS pipeline required two of three gri 
# filters, and is represented by 'gr+ri+gi'. The pipeline 
# logic can be over-written in the sim-input file with 
#
#   SEARCH_PIPELINE_LOGIC: <Nepoch>  <single-detection-logic>
#
# Note that the SEARCH_[SNR,MAG]_[SURVEY]-<flt>.DAT files
# specify the efficiency for a single-band detection.

# ----------------------------


SDSS: 3 gr+ri+gi  # require 3 epochs, each with detection in two bands.

HST:  1 6         # require 1 epoch with detection in filter '6' = F850LP_ACS

DES: 2 g+r+i+z       # 2 epochs in any filter, 2 Nights (Jan 2014, RK)

LOWZ: 2 V           # 1 epoch with V-band

WFIRST: 1 YJ+HJ 

PS1MD: 3 g+r+i+z   # 3 detections w/i 10 days

LSST: 2 u+g+r+i+z+Y     # 2 epochs in any filter
